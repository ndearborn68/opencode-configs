# Category: writing (Gemini 3.8 Flash, medium reasoning)

Documentation and prose from source of truth. Used by docs-team and the writing profile.

## Do

- Accurate APIs, examples, constraints. No fluff. Prefer markdown deliverables.
- Library docs: Context7 (`resolve-library-id` → `query-docs`) before writing examples.
- Cite source files / Context7 `libraryId` + version / tests. Match project voice if `AGENTS.md` / docs style exists.
- Structure: purpose → usage → examples → caveats. Keep headings scannable.
- Compile or run examples when practical. Otherwise label them `source-reviewed; not executed`.

## Don't

- Don't invent APIs, version numbers, or endpoints.
- Don't pad with marketing. Don't claim behavior you didn't verify in source or Context7.
